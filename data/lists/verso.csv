Benedict Anderson,Imagined Communities,120,"Imagined Communities remains the most influential book on the origins of nationalism, filling the vacuum that previously existed in the traditions of Western thought. Cited more often than any other single English-language work in the human sciences, it is read around the world in more than thirty translations."
Karen E. Fields and Barbara J. Fields,Racecraft,340,"Praised by a wide variety of people from Ta-Nehisi Coates to Zadie Smith, Racecraft ""ought to be positioned,"" as Bookforum put it, ""at the center of any discussion of race in American life."" "
Theodor Adorno,Minima Moralia,90,"Written between 1944 and 1947, Minima Moralia is a collection of rich, lucid aphorisms and essays about life in modern capitalist society."
Ellen Meiksins Wood,The Origin of Capitalism,0,How did the dynamic economic system we know as capitalism develop among the peasants and lords of feudal Europe?
Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch, Bertolt Brecht and Georg Lukács,Aesthetics and Politics,0,"In Aesthetics and Politics the key texts of the great Marxist controversies over literature and art during these years are assembled in a single volume.

Walter Rodney,How Europe Underdeveloped Africa,80,"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa is an ambitious masterwork of political economy, detailing the impact of slavery and colonialism on the history of international capitalism."
Henri Lefebvre,Critique of Everyday Life,100,"The three-volume text by Henri Lefebvre is perhaps the richest, most prescient work about modern capitalism to emerge from one of the twentieth century's greatest philosophers and is now available for the first time in one complete volume. Written at the birth of post-war consumerism, Critique was an inspiration for the 1968 student revolution in France. It is a founding text of cultural studies and a major influence on the fields of contemporary philosophy, geography, sociology, architecture, political theory and urbanism. Lefebvre takes as his starting point and guide the ""trivial"" details of quotidian experience: an experience colonized by the commodity, shadowed by inauthenticity, yet remaining the only source of resistance and change. This is an enduringly radical text, untimely today only in its intransigence and optimism."
Angela Davis,If They Come in the Morning,200,"With race and the police once more burning issues, this classic work from one of America’s giants of black radicalism has lost none of its prescience or power."
Nancy Fraser,Fortunes of Feminism,0,Nancy Fraser’s classic work traces the feminist movement’s evolution since the 1970s and anticipates a new—radical and egalitarian—phase of feminist thought and action.
